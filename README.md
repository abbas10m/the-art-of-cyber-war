# The Art of Cyber War

We live in a digital age where major events can be influenced by using or misusing our cyber prowess. Even though the specifics still remain unknown, Moscow’s hand in the 2016 US Presidential Elections is a good indicator. Nations are scrambling to build their cyber arsenal and experts believe that the next World War will most likely be fought on the digital battleground by hackers using code rather than foot-soldiers using guns and bombs.

Attacks against enemy nations can range from minor Denial of Service (DoD) attacks to hacking a country’s vital defense infrastructure like Nuclear Missile Systems and launching it against itself. The possibilities are alarming. 

Cyber-espionages - the practice of spying to get confidential information, is a common practice these days and governments are secretly using them to have an upper hand in the fight for power. 
In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former intelligence contractor and whistleblower from USA made some startling revelations about how the National Security Agency (NSA) with the help of British Intelligence services was spying on international leaders like Prime Minister Angela Merkel of Germany by infiltrating German internet firms. The documents also reveal 122 other leaders being targeted. 
A smartphone with microphone, GPS and camera can potentially be used to spy on a large scale. Snowden’s documents also revealed that the NSA intercepts all phone calls made in Afghanistan and the Bahamas, and collects about 200 million text messages globally containing personal data which in their own words is a “goldmine to exploit”.
Other infamous cyber-espionages include Operation Aurora, 2010 in which intellectual property was stolen from Google, Adobe, Yahoo and about 18 other companies by cyber-attacks believed to have originated out of China.
Similarly, in 2009 thousands of computers in 103 countries were intruded into using Trojan programs by a large spy network known as the GhostNet, again believed to be conceived out of China. The network of Dalai Lama’s offices in India, New York City and London as well as embassies of Iran, South Korea and Germany were targeted by these attacks.


While espionages are mainly used for defensive purposes like surveillance and gathering intelligence for defense against cyber - attacks, Cyber-sabotages – attacks to impair operations of critical infrastructure, are offensive in nature and can cause serious damage to enemy nations.
Power grids in Western Ukraine were attacked by Russian hacker group Sandworm, caused a major outage of power in December, 2015. This happened in the midst of a long ongoing military confrontation between the two nations and provides a model for usage of cyber-warfare to compliment military operations. 

Iran’s Nuclear Program was substantially slowed down by a computer worm known as Stuxnet which was reportedly developed jointly by USA and Israel. Stuxnet was designed to alter the Programmable Logic Controllers of Industrial Control Systems used in supporting facilities like power plants and water treatment facilities. The worm destroyed one-fifth of Iran’s nuclear centrifuges, delaying the progress of their program by years.
The working of the worm seems like a script, right out of a movie. It included two components. The first component sent the centrifuges spinning out of control while the other played out a pre-recorded set of normal readings to the operators, to make them believe everything was working normally while the first component was secretly destroying the centrifuges. 


Sun Tzu in his book titled the Art of War, which influenced the title of this article, says that “the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting”. 

Cyber-propaganda -  an effort to control information and mold public opinion, can destroy enemies without engaging in direct battle with them. The internet boom and extensive outreach of social media makes this a powerful tool in manipulating perception.
Some of the different ways of influencing public opinion include Database hacking – breaking into and stealing data and strategically timing its release to cause an impact; Spreading fake news – releasing fake news on platforms accessible to the masses in a way that it is so realistic that countering its impact and recovering from the damage caused becomes an extremely difficult task.
The US Presidential Elections of 2016 were allegedly shaped by hackers working for the Russian government who supposedly preferred Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton for the job. According to the indictment by US special counsel, hundreds of fraudulent social media accounts were created by the Russians who worked as an organization, impersonating real and fake Americans to criticize Hillary Clinton. They paid for ads promoting their posts and also staged and promoted Pro-Trump and Anti-Hillary political rallies, paying attendees for expenses.
Russian defendant, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina in an email to a family member writes “I created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.”
Trump eventually won the elections and how much of it was a result of this propaganda is anyone’s guess. There’s no denying, though, of how persuasive this technique can be in altering the views of the mob.

With nations developing advanced expertise in cyber-weapons to use against one another, imagine a world where this technology is collectively applied in the war against terrorism – some food for thought!
